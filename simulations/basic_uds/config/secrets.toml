# Security Helper - ECU Secrets for basic_uds simulation
#
# ECU type keys MUST match the component IDs in gateway.toml so the
# SOVD Explorer can resolve them during security access.
#
# Secrets MUST match [security].secret in the corresponding ecu-*.toml
# files, since the example-ecu uses the same XOR algorithm.

# -- Authentication -----------------------------------------------------------
# OIDC mode: users sign in via browser (Google / Entra ID).
# To revert to static token mode, comment out [auth] and pass --token instead.
