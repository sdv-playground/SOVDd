# Security Helper - ECU Secrets for supplier_ota simulation
#
# Only OEM-owned ECUs are listed here. The supplier ECU (vtx_vx500)
# is NOT included — its seed-key secret is owned by the supplier's
# engine app container, which handles security access internally
# during flash operations (see docs/app-entity-architecture.md).
#
# Secrets MUST match [security].secret in the corresponding ecu-*.toml files.
